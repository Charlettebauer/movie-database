I am so excited to have you look at my Movie App project! I hope you enjoy it and I can't wait to talk with you all! 
I used Create-React-App and all you need to do is to run npm start! I thought I would make it easy for you to enjoy. 
I looked closely at the requirements and then expanded a few things while taking the time to learn something new. 
I really enjoyed this project and I hope you do as well.
